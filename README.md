# JoomlaFullContact
This is a Joomla Plugin Form which does a full address contact while creating an account.

We believe this is open source as the original code was included in the API handbook which we modified to do the account creation.
It includes a file manifest, and XML form file, and a PHP automation file which can be modified for your needs. Creating an account is a single function which is well documented by several development teams with different code examples available some of which are more sophisticated. This account creation checks if the requested login name exists already so its pretty useful. It uses Joomla API logic, PHP, and XML scripting.[JOOMLAFORM3CREATIONcom_sample_form3.zip](https://github.com/greenvilleassociates/JoomlaFullContact/files/10981052/JOOMLAFORM3CREATIONcom_sample_form3.zip)
